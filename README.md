Project which use database. Car Rental allows to reserve and borrow selected car from lists.
As a user you can choose the car brand, model and date.
Aplication shows price, chosen car and time interval how long you borrow car.
aplication is still in procces. Im going to add admin and employee windows that allows to check all reservations, adding or deleting borrows and users.
Admin would be able to add new cars to database and change user dates like name, surname and more.
